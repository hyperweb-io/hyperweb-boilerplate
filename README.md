# Hyperweb Boilerplate

Welcome to **Hyperweb**, the blockchain for JavaScript smart contracts. Hyperweb enables developers to write decentralized applications (dApps) using TypeScript, designed for cross-chain compatibility and ease of development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperweb-io/hyperweb-boilerplate.git

yarn
```

## Quickstart

### Bundle Contracts

1. Clean previous builds:
```bash
yarn clean
```
2. Build contracts:
```bash
yarn build
```

This bundles the contracts from src/** into dist/contracts/.

## Infrastructure Setup

### Option 1: Using Starship
[Starship](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship) is a Kubernetes-based blockchain orchestrator. It sets up a local blockchain environment with full cross-chain compatibility.

#### Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop includes a standalone Kubernetes server and client, as well as Docker CLI integration that runs on your machine.
To enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop:

1. From the Docker Dashboard, select the Settings.
2. Select Kubernetes from the left sidebar.
3. Next to Enable Kubernetes, select the checkbox.
4. Select Apply & Restart to save the settings and then click Install to confirm.

#### Install `kubectl` and `helm`. 
```bash
yarn starship install  ## and follow steps to install kubectl and helm
```

#### Start Starship
```bash
yarn starship start
```
Spins up a local blockchain using configs/local.yaml.
Wait for Starship to initialize.

For more details, refer to the [Starship Docs](https://docs.cosmology.zone/starship/).

### Option 2: Using Docker
Alternatively, Hyperweb can be run using Docker, which simplifies setup and enables you to interact with the blockchain without requiring Kubernetes.

#### Run Hyperweb with Docker
To spin up the chain using Docker, the following scripts are available in the package.json:

* Run Docker container:
  ```bash
  yarn docker
  ```

* Stop and remove the container:
  ```bash
  yarn docker:stop
  ```

### Interact with chain

This will set up the same chain environment that Starship provides, allowing you to interact with the chain using the same endpoints:
* REST: http://localhost:1317
* RPC: http://localhost:26657
* Faucet: http://localhost:8000
* Exposer: http://localhost:8081
* Registry: http://localhost:8001

Once the chain is running, you can follow the same steps to interact with the chain and run tests as detailed below.

## Run Tests
Once the setup it complete, you can run tests to validate the contract functionality.
Run tests:
```bash
yarn test
```
The test suite deploys the contracts, interacts with them, and validates state transitions. The tests are located in `__tests__/`.

## Usage

### Creating JSD Client

Once the contract is bundled, you need to create a client using `hyperwebjs` to interact with the Hyperweb chain.

Example setup to create a `hyperwebjs` client:

```ts
import { getSigningJsdClient, jsd } from 'hyperwebjs';

async function setupClient() {
  const wallet = await DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic("your-mnemonic");
  const rpcEndpoint = "your-rpc-endpoint";

  const signingClient = await getSigningJsdClient({
    rpcEndpoint,
    signer: wallet
  });

  return signingClient;
}
```

### Deploying and Interacting with the Contract

To deploy and instantiate the contract on the Hyperweb blockchain, read the bundled contract file and use the `hyperwebjs` client to broadcast it to the chain.

Example deployment process:

```ts
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

async function deployContract(signingClient, address) {
  const contractCode = fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, '../dist/contracts/bundle1.js'), 'utf8');

  const msg = jsd.jsd.MessageComposer.fromPartial.instantiate({
    creator: address,
    code: contractCode,
  });

  const fee = { amount: [{ denom: 'token', amount: '100000' }], gas: '550000' };

  const result = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(address, [msg], fee);
  console.log('Contract deployed:', result);
}
```

### Instantiating a Contract

To instantiate the contract, use the `instantiate` method of the `hyperwebjs` client. The contract index will be returned, which is used to interact with the contract.

```ts
const contractCode = fs.readFileSync('dist/contracts/bundle1.js', 'utf8');
const result = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(address, [
  jsd.jsd.MessageComposer.fromPartial.instantiate({
    creator: address,
    code: contractCode,
  })
], fee);

const contractIndex = jsd.jsd.MsgInstantiateResponse.fromProtoMsg(result.msgResponses[0]).index;
console.log('Contract instantiated with index:', contractIndex);
```

### Interacting with the Contract

Once the contract is instantiated, you can invoke functions like `inc`, `dec`, or `read` to interact with it.

Example to increment a value:

```ts
const msg = jsd.jsd.MessageComposer.fromPartial.eval({
  creator: address,
  index: contractIndex,
  fnName: "inc",
  arg: JSON.stringify({ x: 10 }),
});

const result = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(address, [msg], fee);
console.log('Increment result:', result);
```

### Evaluating Functions on the Contract

To evaluate functions like `inc`, `dec`, or any other function within the contract, you can use the `eval` message type.

Example to decrement a value:

```ts
const msg = jsd.jsd.MessageComposer.fromPartial.eval({
  creator: address,
  index: contractIndex,
  fnName: "dec",
  arg: JSON.stringify({ x: 5 }),
});

const result = await signingClient.signAndBroadcast(address, [msg], fee);
console.log('Decrement result:', result);
```

### Reading Contract State

You can query the state of the contract by using the `read` function.

Example to read the contract state:

```ts
const state = await queryClient.jsd.jsd.localState({ index: contractIndex, key: 'value' });
console.log('Contract state:', state);
```

---

## Development

For local development, you can run the tests provided in the `__tests__/` folder to validate contract functionality using `starshipjs` to simulate chain interactions.
